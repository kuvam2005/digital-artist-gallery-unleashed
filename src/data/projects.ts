    tagline: "A challenging bridge-building game with precision mechanics",
    description: "Stick Hero is a challenging mobile game where players must create bridges of the perfect length to help their character cross between platforms. The game tests your timing and precision as you attempt to build bridges that are just the right lengthâ€”too short and your character falls, too long and you'll miss your target. I developed this game to explore the mechanics of simple yet engaging gameplay that creates a 'just one more try' experience for players of all ages.",
